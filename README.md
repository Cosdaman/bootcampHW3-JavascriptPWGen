# bootcampHW3-JavascriptPWGen

Description:  
This project is aimed to demonstrate the developer's understanding of basic javascript.

The application created is a password generator.  
When the user presses the "Generate Password" button, the website will then ask the user a series of questions to determine the criteria of the password.  
Once the user has successfully entered valid responses to the questions, the generator will then generate a password based on the criteria that the user has provided.
